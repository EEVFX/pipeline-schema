EEVFX Pipeline Toolkit Standard Project Configuration

This is a toolkit and project schema configuration tailored for
EEVFX community. It is based on the original tk-config-default Shotgun
toolkit configuration.

Main tools are the same as Shotgun toolkit, for information visit:

In addition to providing a configuration for Shotgun users the schema
is used for different additional pipeline tools: ingest, backup & archival,
cloud based push-pull toolset etc.

This schema and toolset is part of the EEVFX common pipeline.
